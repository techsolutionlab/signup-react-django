## How to Run

To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

### 1. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install
```

Or if you're using yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

### 2. Run the Development Server

Start the development server by running:

```bash
npm start
```

Or with yarn:

```bash
yarn start
```

### 3. Open the Application

Once the server is running, open your browser and go to:

```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

You should now see the signup form in your browser.

### 4. Additional Configuration (Optional)

If you want to run the app in a different environment (e.g., production), you can build the project using:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a build folder with the production-ready version of the app. You can deploy this folder to your server or static hosting platform.
